# JunaChimp

As a common reference space for the analysis of chimpanzee brain data, we created the Juna.Chimp template, constructed from a large heterogeneous sample of T1-weighted MRIâ€™s from the NCBR (http://www.chimpanzeebrain.org/). The Juna.Chimp template includes a reference T1-template, along with probability maps of brain and head tissues accompanied by a Geodesic Shooting template for the publicly available SPM12/CAT12 preprocessing pipeline to efficiently segment and spatially normalize individual chimpanzee T1 images. 

/example_workflow shows how our newly created templates can be used to preprocess chimpanzee structrual T1-weighted images. 

/age_asym provideds the scripts used for the analysis in our paper.
